Creating "Carl Bot", a robotic chess robot, proved to be a captivating and challenging journey. Tasked with integrating game logic and movement on a chessboard, my team and I harnessed diverse technologies to achieve our vision. Named after world champion Magnus Carlsen, "Carl Bot" utilized Lego components for mechanical assembly, providing both customization and ease of setup.

To enable decision-making abilities and movement, we employed C++ and RobotC to program the robot's logic. The true innovation lay in the ski system, featuring a mounted pulley for x-y movement and an actuator for vertical claw movement, ensuring precise and fluid manipulation of chess pieces. To further enhance accuracy, we incorporated motor encoders, sensors, and actuators, ensuring seamless control over the claw's movement, making piece selection and movement effortless.

The result was an impressive robotic chess robot, capable of executing precise moves, identifying chess pieces, and even evaluating basic game logic. The project's resounding success showcased our dedication and skill in robotics and programming. Witnessing "Carl Bot" come to life in all its sophistication and precision was an immensely rewarding experience, validating our hard work and problem-solving prowess. The integration of multiple sensors and motors played a pivotal role in making "Carl Bot" robust and versatile, ready to tackle complex chess challenges with ease.
