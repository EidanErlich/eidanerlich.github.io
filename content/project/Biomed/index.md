Imagine having the chance to embark on an independent research project with an ophthalmologist, exploring cutting-edge technology to revolutionize surgical instruments in ophthalmology. I was fortunate enough to experience just that. This is the story of my endeavor to explore the feasibility of using 3D printing technology to create precise surgical instruments for eye surgeries, the challenges I faced, and the exhilarating successes that followed.

The foundation of the project lay in comprehensive research and design. We sought to develop a scleral depressor and a proprietary light cap with custom ends, each serving a unique purpose in surgeries around the eye. It was essential to meticulously investigate various 3D printers, and after thorough evaluation, we opted for the Formlabs 3B+ due to its remarkable precision capabilities. As surgical tools necessitate utmost precision, this choice was critical.

Selecting the right resin was equally vital, and after evaluating several options, it was discovered that Biomed Clear resin offered the required biocompatibility and strength for surgical settings. Ensuring safety was paramount, and this research paved the way for the subsequent phases of our project.

With the research as the foundation, I delved into the initial development and rapid prototyping stage. Swiftly iterating through designs, I collaborated closely with MD residents, collecting their valuable feedback and using it to refine the prototypes. Root cause analysis and Design of Experiment (DOE) played a crucial role in this phase, enabling us to address issues and enhance the design.

Witnessing my creations come to life and being used in real-world surgical settings was an indescribable feeling. It was heartening to see the positive impact our work had on patients, knowing that we were contributing to better outcomes in eye surgeries.

It was an incredible opportunity to lead a team comprising MD residents and master's students. One of our most notable achievements was the implementation of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) principles combined with 3D printing, which remarkably reduced manufacturing costs by over 90%. Witnessing the transformation and cost-effectiveness of our designs was immensely gratifying.

In addition to our practical accomplishments, I authored several technical reports, presenting my research findings to the team. These reports will support an upcoming scientific paper and journal publication, ensuring that our work reaches a broader audience and impacts the field of ophthalmology.

I am incredibly proud to share that the fruits of our labor have not gone unnoticed. The success and potential of our project caught the attention of the University Health Network (UHN), which has taken it up for further growth and development. This development is a testament to the significance and impact of our work in the field of ophthalmology.

Seeing our project embraced by such a prestigious institution like the UHN is a dream come true. It speaks volumes about the dedication and hard work put into the project by our team. This collaboration opens up a world of possibilities, as the UHN's resources and expertise will undoubtedly propel our project to new heights.
