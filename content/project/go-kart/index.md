As a collaborative team effort, we embarked on an ambitious project to design and fabricate an electric go-kart, making the most of available tools and materials. Leading the design phase, I meticulously crafted the go-kart using Computer-Aided Design (CAD), ensuring precision and efficiency in the manufacturing process. Employing scrap metal and leftover materials from previous projects, we embraced a sustainable approach that not only saved costs but also exemplified our commitment to recycling and repurposing, minimizing waste and maximizing resources.

Innovative thinking and diligent planning played a pivotal role as my partner and I brainstormed ideas, sketched designs, and created detailed CAD mock-ups. To bring our vision to life, we pitched the project to our school and successfully secured the funding required for its realization, despite facing tight budgetary and deadline constraints. I spearheaded the selection and sourcing of critical components, such as motor controllers, batteries, and mechanical modules, demonstrating a keen eye for balancing performance with cost-effectiveness.

Integrating the electronic controls seamlessly with the custom powertrain, I optimized the go-kart's power-to-weight ratio, resulting in a remarkable 150% power increase. The go-kart effortlessly reached high speeds while maintaining exceptional maneuverability, offering an exhilarating and dynamic driving experience.

The final product was a stunning yet resourceful electric go-kart, elegantly showcasing our engineering prowess and passion for motorsports. The sense of accomplishment upon seeing our hard work materialize into a fully functional and stylish mode of transportation was immensely gratifying.

Our go-kart stood as a testament to the potential of sustainable engineering practices and the fusion of innovation and creativity. This project allowed me to combine my passion for engineering and motorsports, furthering my personal and professional growth. I take great pride in the successful outcome and the valuable skills honed throughout the process. Working on this project alongside a dedicated team was an invaluable experience, reinforcing the belief that determination, ingenuity, and collaboration can lead to extraordinary achievements.
