As part of the Toyota Innovation Challenge, I successfully built an autonomous machine vision algorithm in a simulated manufacturing environment, utilizing C++ object-oriented programming and cutting-edge computer vision libraries like OpenCV to track a 1:24 scale car model, identify its wheels, and provide real-time positioning data using a depth camera, enhancing manufacturing processes with optimal efficiency and precision. Moreover, I implemented an advanced event trigger system for dynamic capabilities and devised a custom formula to convert radial data into real-world positions, while the addition of dynamic visual feedback improved interpretability and troubleshooting, making it a standout and rewarding project in computer vision and OOP. Notably, our team was one of only three that successfully completed all the objectives in the challenge, solidifying our position as top performers in the competition.
