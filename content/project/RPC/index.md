In this project, we took on the challenge of implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict rock-paper-scissors movements. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Yolov5, TensorFlow, and MoViNets, we designed a powerful model capable of accurately classifying the hand gestures. To ensure optimal performance, we devoted significant effort to data pre-processing, undertaking comprehensive steps to enhance the model's precision. As a result, our CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 84%, a testament to the effectiveness of our approach and the significance of the project in the realm of computer vision and gesture recognition.
