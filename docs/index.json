Let’s dive into the details of SoilAri and how it aims to address critical challenges in the agricultural landscape.\nThe Problem: Smallholder farmers play a crucial role in feeding the world’s population, yet they face numerous obstacles. In particular, farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are grappling with changing climates and skyrocketing fertilizer costs. With SSA importing 80% of its fertilizer and prices doubling in a year, many farmers can only afford to use a fraction of the required nutrients. These issues are exacerbating poverty and food insecurity in the region.\nSoilAri’s team recognized the pressing need to address challenges faced by smallholder farmers in SSA, particularly in Kenya. Agriculture contributes approximately 33% of Kenya’s GDP, making it a vital sector. Our solution aims to target 220,000 farmers in Kenya during the pilot launch, with the potential to expand our services to more smallholder farms globally.\nOur project involves multiple stakeholders, including individual farmers, their communities, players in the agricultural industry, and the surrounding ecosystems. By empowering farmers with data-driven insights, we anticipate a substantial impact on water and fertilizer usage, leading to more efficient agricultural practices and sustainable resource management.\nThe core of SoilAri’s functionality lies in providing easily digestible data related to irrigation, fertilization based on crop type, and accessibility via simple text messaging. By collecting user input, such as coordinates, farm size, and other relevant data, we leverage APIs and databases to perform calculations and generate targeted insights. Farmers will receive recommendations for optimal fertilization and irrigation practices tailored to their specific needs.\nSoilAri harnesses telemetry data, empowering farmers to make informed decisions. With just a phone and a simple text message, a Kenyan farmer can access valuable information about their location, crop type, and farm size, receiving real-time insights for fertilization and irrigation. This data-driven approach enables farmers to enhance their yields and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.\nBy partnering with local fertilizer producers, we aim to introduce a 5% commission rate on all sales made through our platform. This revenue, combined with national grants and commissions on fertilization orders, is projected to generate substantial profits over the next five years. We plan to reinvest these profits into supporting small-scale farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.\nSoilAri envisions a transformative impact in the agricultural landscape, increasing crop yields by 40% and fostering more efficient distribution chains. Our solution aims to enhance food security in the face of formidable challenges. By diversifying revenue streams and fostering collaborations with major contributors, we are confident in our ability to create a positive change in the lives of smallholder farmers.\nThank you for joining us on this journey as we introduced SoilAri, a groundbreaking project aimed at empowering smallholder farmers in Kenya and beyond. We believe that by harnessing the power of data, we can unlock the potential of sustainable agriculture, contributing to a more resilient and prosperous future for farming communities. If you have any questions or want to learn more, we would be delighted to hear from you. Together, let’s sow the seeds of change and cultivate a more sustainable world!\n","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"082d6028b1fd6c4fae0627cad40c84ce","permalink":"https://eidanerlich.github.io/project/soilari/","publishdate":"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/soilari/","section":"project","summary":"An accessible web and SMS platform for small-sclae farmers to get location-specific insights on their crops","tags":["Machine Learning","Business"],"title":"SoilAri, data-driven optimization of small-scale farms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"ffc192aa6f0138b7eade45b47887f5f7","permalink":"https://eidanerlich.github.io/post/mprw-ourteam/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mprw-ourteam/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"MIT-PITT-RW - Our Team","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Creating “Carl Bot”, a robotic chess robot, proved to be a captivating and challenging journey.
