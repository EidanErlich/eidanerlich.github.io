Let’s dive into the details of SoilAri and how it aims to address critical challenges in the agricultural landscape.\nThe Problem: Smallholder farmers play a crucial role in feeding the world’s population, yet they face numerous obstacles. In particular, farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are grappling with changing climates and skyrocketing fertilizer costs. With SSA importing 80% of its fertilizer and prices doubling in a year, many farmers can only afford to use a fraction of the required nutrients. These issues are exacerbating poverty and food insecurity in the region.\nSoilAri’s team recognized the pressing need to address challenges faced by smallholder farmers in SSA, particularly in Kenya. Agriculture contributes approximately 33% of Kenya’s GDP, making it a vital sector. Our solution aims to target 220,000 farmers in Kenya during the pilot launch, with the potential to expand our services to more smallholder farms globally.\nOur project involves multiple stakeholders, including individual farmers, their communities, players in the agricultural industry, and the surrounding ecosystems. By empowering farmers with data-driven insights, we anticipate a substantial impact on water and fertilizer usage, leading to more efficient agricultural practices and sustainable resource management.\nThe core of SoilAri’s functionality lies in providing easily digestible data related to irrigation, fertilization based on crop type, and accessibility via simple text messaging. By collecting user input, such as coordinates, farm size, and other relevant data, we leverage APIs and databases to perform calculations and generate targeted insights. Farmers will receive recommendations for optimal fertilization and irrigation practices tailored to their specific needs.\nSoilAri harnesses telemetry data, empowering farmers to make informed decisions. With just a phone and a simple text message, a Kenyan farmer can access valuable information about their location, crop type, and farm size, receiving real-time insights for fertilization and irrigation. This data-driven approach enables farmers to enhance their yields and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.\nBy partnering with local fertilizer producers, we aim to introduce a 5% commission rate on all sales made through our platform. This revenue, combined with national grants and commissions on fertilization orders, is projected to generate substantial profits over the next five years. We plan to reinvest these profits into supporting small-scale farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture practices.\nSoilAri envisions a transformative impact in the agricultural landscape, increasing crop yields by 40% and fostering more efficient distribution chains. Our solution aims to enhance food security in the face of formidable challenges. By diversifying revenue streams and fostering collaborations with major contributors, we are confident in our ability to create a positive change in the lives of smallholder farmers.\nThank you for joining us on this journey as we introduced SoilAri, a groundbreaking project aimed at empowering smallholder farmers in Kenya and beyond. We believe that by harnessing the power of data, we can unlock the potential of sustainable agriculture, contributing to a more resilient and prosperous future for farming communities. If you have any questions or want to learn more, we would be delighted to hear from you. Together, let’s sow the seeds of change and cultivate a more sustainable world!\n","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"082d6028b1fd6c4fae0627cad40c84ce","permalink":"https://eidanerlich.github.io/project/soilari/","publishdate":"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/soilari/","section":"project","summary":"An accessible web and SMS platform for small-sclae farmers to get location-specific insights on their crops","tags":["Machine Learning","Business"],"title":"SoilAri, data-driven optimization of small-scale farms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Creating “Carl Bot”, a robotic chess robot, proved to be a captivating and challenging journey.

The overarching objective was to achieve a high level of precision in forecasting house prices by analyzing pertinent metrics extracted from public datasets.\nTo commence the project, I undertook the task of training two distinct supervised machine learning models. The first model was based on the widely utilized decision tree algorithm, which formed the initial foundation for predicting house prices. The critical challenge at this stage was to determine the optimal decision tree depth that would strike a delicate balance between overfitting and underfitting the data. To address this, I employed a combination of mean absolute error and cross-validation trade-off techniques, allowing me to maximize the model’s accuracy while ensuring its generalizability.\nThrough this iterative process, I was able to identify the ideal decision tree depth, enhancing the model’s performance considerably. Subsequently, I embarked on training and fitting a random forest model to the dataset. The random forest model demonstrated enhanced accuracy when compared to the decision tree model, emerging as the more powerful predictor of house prices.\nA pivotal aspect of this project was the challenge of acquiring a relevant and robust dataset, along with identifying features that exhibited strong correlations with house prices. To overcome this, I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the data, implementing feature selection techniques such as variance threshold to isolate the most influential features. By utilizing these selected features as inputs for the machine learning models, and house prices as the target variable, I was able to effectively train the models for accurate predictions.\nTo assess the performance of the models, I employed diverse evaluation metrics, including mean squared error and mean absolute error. The results indicated that the random forest model consistently outperformed the decision tree algorithm, yielding an impressive accuracy rate of +/- 15% compared to the 25% from the decision tree model.\nIn summary, this project showcased my adeptness in applying advanced machine learning techniques to real-world problems. From the meticulous data preprocessing and feature selection to model training and evaluation, the project highlighted my proficiency in Python programming and the effective utilization of machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.\nThe successful outcome of this project not only reaffirmed my technical prowess but also underscored my ability to approach complex challenges in data analysis and predictive modeling with a methodical and data-driven approach. The experience gained from this project has undoubtedly equipped me to take on future endeavors with unwavering confidence in applying machine learning solutions to various domains, ultimately advancing the field of data science.\n","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669852800,"objectID":"af7aab0f40ed9cab8999b7a7c36992fa","permalink":"https://eidanerlich.github.io/project/home-price-prediction/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/home-price-prediction/","section":"project","summary":"The project involved utilizing Python and advanced supervised machine learning techniques to predict home prices","tags":["Machine Learning","Business"],"title":"Machine Learning Home Price Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of the Toyota Innovation Challenge, I successfully built an autonomous machine vision algorithm in a simulated manufacturing environment, utilizing C++ object-oriented programming and cutting-edge computer vision libraries like OpenCV to track a 1:24 scale car model, identify its wheels, and provide real-time positioning data using a depth camera, enhancing manufacturing processes with optimal efficiency and precision.

Leading the design phase, I meticulously crafted the go-kart using Computer-Aided Design (CAD), ensuring precision and efficiency in the manufacturing process. Employing scrap metal and leftover materials from previous projects, we embraced a sustainable approach that not only saved costs but also exemplified our commitment to recycling and repurposing, minimizing waste and maximizing resources.\nInnovative thinking and diligent planning played a pivotal role as my partner and I brainstormed ideas, sketched designs, and created detailed CAD mock-ups. To bring our vision to life, we pitched the project to our school and successfully secured the funding required for its realization, despite facing tight budgetary and deadline constraints. I spearheaded the selection and sourcing of critical components, such as motor controllers, batteries, and mechanical modules, demonstrating a keen eye for balancing performance with cost-effectiveness.\nIntegrating the electronic controls seamlessly with the custom powertrain, I optimized the go-kart’s power-to-weight ratio, resulting in a remarkable 150% power increase. The go-kart effortlessly reached high speeds while maintaining exceptional maneuverability, offering an exhilarating and dynamic driving experience.\nThe final product was a stunning yet resourceful electric go-kart, elegantly showcasing our engineering prowess and passion for motorsports. The sense of accomplishment upon seeing our hard work materialize into a fully functional and stylish mode of transportation was immensely gratifying.\nOur go-kart stood as a testament to the potential of sustainable engineering practices and the fusion of innovation and creativity. This project allowed me to combine my passion for engineering and motorsports, furthering my personal and professional growth. I take great pride in the successful outcome and the valuable skills honed throughout the process. Working on this project alongside a dedicated team was an invaluable experience, reinforcing the belief that determination, ingenuity, and collaboration can lead to extraordinary achievements.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ab7cf7c4b0b78af54ad83ca3ec0db331","permalink":"https://eidanerlich.github.io/project/go-kart/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/go-kart/","section":"project","summary":"I led the design and fabrication of an innovative electric go-kart using CAD and repurposed materials","tags":["CAD","Robotics"],"title":"Fully electric Go-Kart","type":"project"}]
